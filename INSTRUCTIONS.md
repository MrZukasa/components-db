# Instructions ðŸ¤“
In order to make things work properly you need to have two spaces where to put frontend of this project and, of course, backend.

I usually have the frontend hosted on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and the backend hosted on [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/), if you want to do the same, you need to have an account on both of the website.

I suggest you to make also an account here on [github.com](https://github.com/) and clone this two repository, so, in that way you have [front](https://github.com/MrZukasa/components-db-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/MrZukasa/components-db-backend) separated and up to go.

> N.B. to clone stuff on github, you need to use [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), just install it and go for `git clone [URL you want to clone]` in the shell like this

Once you got both side of the project you can open it in your preferred editor, i use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Another thing that is mandatory is [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/it/) donwload it and install it.
