# Instructions ðŸ¤“
In order to make things work properly you need to have two spaces where to put frontend of this project and, of course, backend.

I usually have the frontend hosted on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and the backend hosted on [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/), if you want to do the same, you need to have an account on both of the website.

I suggest you to make also an account here on [github.com](https://github.com/) and clone this two repository, so, in that way you have [front](https://github.com/MrZukasa/components-db-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/MrZukasa/components-db-backend) separated and up to go.

> N.B. to clone stuff on github, you need to use [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), just install it and go for `git clone [URL you want to clone]` in the shell like this

Once you got both side of the project you can open it in your preferred editor, i use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Another thing that is mandatory is [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/it/) donwload it and install it.

Now load both the project in a separate folder and in each folder download the required dipencencies by using `npm install` in the terminal.

Done that, we need confugire the database that serve the backend directry in our heroku website, you can can use whatever you want as a database service, but as i mentioned above, i usually use this. There are a tons of tutorials available out there, heres [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16OIg7cyLw4) for mysql db in heroku.
> N.B. for a development purpose, i usually use Laragon, which provide the developer to everything he may need. [Here is](https://laragon.org/) Laragon has phpManager in it, with that you can easily create the DB structure.

The DB structure that we use in this project is the following:
- Database name 'Archivio'
- Table name 'Componenti'

this is what you have to replicate on heroku's database in order to make things work.
Once tha the backend is ready, you can create your own repository on github.com and push the code, after that, you can link the repository that you have created to heroku, in order to create a new backend app running always with the lastest version available of your code.

Then you have to do the same thing with the frontend but on netlify.com, which means:
 - Create a repo on github.com that contains the code
 - Link that repo to your netlify.com account and set it up to go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h8B080Mv4U) is how. Remember that google is your friend ðŸ˜‚
